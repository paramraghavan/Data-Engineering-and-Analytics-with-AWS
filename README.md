# Data-Engineering-and-Analysis-with-AWS
This is based on my experience working with AWS, resources available in AWS and my curious web searches.

## Architecting on AWS
When archtecting our system we should separate compute from storage. We should use the open data format like apache parquet, Avro, ORC. etc. I have mostly use parquet, but in some cses used csv as that was the consumers requirement.
