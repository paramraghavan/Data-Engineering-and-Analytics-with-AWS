Performing **reconciliation (recon)** with existing or already ingested data involves comparing data between the **source** and the **target** systems to ensure accuracy, completeness, and consistency. Here's how to approach it step by step:

---

### **1. Define Recon Objectives**
Before starting recon, determine what you're validating:
- **Row Count Check**: Ensure the number of records in the source matches the target.
- **Data Integrity Check**: Ensure the values of individual fields in the source match the target.
- **Uniqueness Check**: Verify there are no duplicate records in the target.
- **Completeness Check**: Ensure all records from the source have been ingested.
- **Data Range Check**: Validate that all records fall within the expected ranges (e.g., timestamps or IDs).

---

### **2. Identify a Reconciliation Key**
Select a column or set of columns that uniquely identify a record (e.g., `id`, `transaction_id`, or a combination of columns). This will be the basis for matching source and target records.

---

### **3. Retrieve Data from Source and Target**
- Use queries or export the data to flat files from both the source and target systems.
- For large datasets, retrieve data in **batches** based on a time range, partition, or high-watermark to manage memory and performance.

#### Example:
```sql
-- Source Query
SELECT id, name, amount, last_modified 
FROM source_table 
WHERE last_modified >= '2025-01-01';

-- Target Query
SELECT id, name, amount, last_modified 
FROM target_table 
WHERE last_modified >= '2025-01-01';
```

---

### **4. Compare Row Counts**
1. **Source Row Count**:
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) AS source_count 
   FROM source_table;
   ```

2. **Target Row Count**:
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) AS target_count 
   FROM target_table;
   ```

3. **Check Discrepancy**:
   Compare the counts. Any mismatch indicates missing or extra records.

---

### **5. Perform Field-Level Validation**
Join the source and target datasets on the reconciliation key to validate individual field values.

#### SQL Example for Validation:
```sql
SELECT s.id, s.name AS source_name, t.name AS target_name, s.amount AS source_amount, t.amount AS target_amount
FROM source_table s
LEFT JOIN target_table t ON s.id = t.id
WHERE s.name != t.name OR s.amount != t.amount;
```

#### Expected Results:
- Rows returned indicate discrepancies in the values of specific fields.

---

### **6. Identify Missing or Extra Records**
#### Missing Records in Target:
```sql
SELECT s.*
FROM source_table s
LEFT JOIN target_table t ON s.id = t.id
WHERE t.id IS NULL;
```

#### Extra Records in Target:
```sql
SELECT t.*
FROM target_table t
LEFT JOIN source_table s ON t.id = s.id
WHERE s.id IS NULL;
```

### **7. Automate Recon for Large Datasets**
For large-scale data:
1. Use **checksums** or **hashing** for quick comparison:
   - Generate a checksum for each row or batch (e.g., MD5 or SHA-256).
   - Compare checksums between source and target.
   ```sql
   SELECT MD5(CONCAT_WS(',', id, name, amount)) AS row_hash
   FROM source_table;
   ```
2. Use **ETL/ELT tools**:
   - Tools like Apache Nifi, Talend, Informatica, or AWS Glue can help automate recon processes.

---

### **8. Reconcile with High-Watermark**
- Compare data based on incremental high-watermarks to focus only on recent ingested data.
- Query both source and target for records after the last reconciled watermark.

---

### **9. Log and Report Findings**
1. Create a **reconciliation report** with:
   - Total records in source and target.
   - Number of mismatched records.
   - Details of missing or extra records.
2. Log the details for future reference or audits.

---

### **10. Address Discrepancies**
- **Missing Records**: Reload the data.
- **Incorrect Data**: Update or reload the impacted records.
- **Extra Records**: Remove duplicates or invalid entries from the target.
