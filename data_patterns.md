# Data Patterns


## Longitudinal data
Longitudinal data is data that is collected sequentially from the same respondents over time. This type of data can be very important in tracking trends and changes over time by asking the same respondents questions in several waves carried out of time.

Longitudinal patient dataset (data that track the same patients over the course of many years) that will guide us to make the best treatment decisions based on actual, real-life experience from patients similar to the individual needing care. For example, longitudinal data helps to answer the question, “I had my aortic valve replaced 15 years ago. Based on the experience of patients with medical histories similar to myself, what course of treatment should I follow when it begins to fail?”
