# A Reconciliation and data quality outline for your ingestion pipelines. 
- Reconciliation
- Quality checks:

1. Source to Landing  Reconciliation:
- File count reconciliation
  - Track number of files received  vs files moved to S3
  - Maintain a manifest/control table with file metadata including:
    - File name, timestamp, size, checksum
    - Source system identifier
    - Expected vs actual file arrival time
    - Processing status
- Implement file integrity checks
  - Calculate checksums at source and destination
  - Verify file sizes match
  - Check file format validity

2. Landing to Raw (S3 to Snowflake) Reconciliation:
- Record count validation
  - Compare row counts between source files and loaded tables
  - Track rejected records and load errors
- Data completeness checks
  - Verify all expected columns are present
  - Check for null values in mandatory fields
- Implement batch control framework
  - Generate unique batch IDs for each load
  - Track start/end times, status, and error messages
  - Monitor processing SLAs

3. Raw to Transformed Data Reconciliation:
- Row-level reconciliation
  - Compare source and target record counts by key business dimensions
  - Track inserted/updated/deleted records
- Financial/Statistical reconciliation
  - Sum key numeric columns before and after transformation
  - Calculate control totals for critical business metrics
- Data quality rules
  - Business rule validation
  - Referential integrity checks
  - Format validation

Here's a proposed technical implementation:



To implement this framework effectively:

1. Monitoring and Alerting:
- Set up dashboards to track reconciliation metrics
- Configure alerts for:
  - Missing files or delayed arrivals
  - Record count mismatches
  - Control total discrepancies
  - Data quality rule violations
  - SLA breaches

2. Historical Reconciliation:
- Maintain historical reconciliation data
- Implement period-over-period comparisons
- Track trends in data quality metrics
- Enable audit capabilities for compliance

3. Operational Considerations:
- Document all reconciliation rules and thresholds
- Establish clear escalation procedures
- Define SLAs for resolution of discrepancies
- Create runbooks for common reconciliation issues

4. Best Practices:
- **Implement idempotent processing**
- Use transaction control for atomic operations
- Maintain detailed logging at each step
- Version control all reconciliation logic
- Regular testing of reconciliation procedures
