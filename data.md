Only 10% of all data collected or generated by businesses is structured data, another 10% of all data collected or generated by businesses is semistructured data, and the rest—the other 80%—is unstructured data.

- **Structured data**
relational or structured data. That data is commonly stored in relational databases, hence the name. It is highly structured by rules and constraints set within the database. 
This kind of data is the backbone for transactional applications. Structured data is organized and stored in the form of values that are grouped into rows and columns of a table.
- **Semi-structured data**
This data is often stored in non-relational (often called NoSQL) databases or even XML or JSON files. This data does not have a strict structure and is often more temporary 
in nature. Examples include the moves you make in an online video game, your internet browser cache, and even social apps that automatically delete your posts after a certain
amount of time. Semistructured data is often stored in a series of key-value pairs that are grouped into elements within a file.
- **Unstructured data**
This data often takes the form of files or objects, has no single structure, and represents everything else that a business collects and generates. This data is often considered
untouchable because it does not meet conventional norms. It requires tagging and cataloging in order to be analyzed, and this prevents many businesses from using it in their data
analysis solutions. Examples include images, email messages, text files, social media content, text messages, and videos. Unstructured data is not structured in a consistent way. Some data may have structure similar to semi-structured data but others may only contain metadata.
