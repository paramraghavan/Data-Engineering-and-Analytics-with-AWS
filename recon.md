# Recon process for entire ingestion pipeline
200+ pipelines performing ingestions, some of them are incremental, some of them are full load, some of the small loads are sometimes incremental other times full load
identify the  recon processes that be applied 
* to make sure we ingest what we get.
* Data quality check.

Here's a systematic approach:

1. Source-to-Landing Reconciliation
   - Record count comparison between source and landing area
   - File size/byte count comparison for file-based ingestion
   - Checksum verification of loaded files
   - Timestamp tracking of last successful load
   - For incremental loads: tracking of watermark/high-water mark values

2. Data Quality Checks at Landing
   - Null checks for critical fields
   - Data type validation
   - Date format consistency
   - Range checks for numeric fields
   - Pattern matching for standardized fields (e.g., email, phone)
   - Duplicate record detection

3. Load Pattern Analysis
   - Monitor volume patterns (e.g., expected daily/weekly/monthly volumes)
   - Track historical patterns of full vs incremental loads
   - Set up anomaly detection for unexpected volume changes
   - Maintain metrics on load duration and resource utilization

4. End-to-End Reconciliation
   - For full loads: source-to-target record count matching
   - For incremental loads: 
     - Delta record validation
     - Comparison of changed records against source
     - Verification of unchanged records remaining intact
   - Running totals/aggregates comparison for key metrics
